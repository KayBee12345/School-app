      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">The food options and responsibilities to consider canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutricial choices. Each student or staff member who have access to the canteen coud be provided with a school canteen account on the school website which keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietrary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again diversity is the key.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendances management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate perforamance data.</p>
